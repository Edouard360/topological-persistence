# Simplices

Before computing the filtration, we triangulate our different structures. 
In the `/assets` folder, you can find the *.png* images that led to these different triangulations.

These .txt files will be processed, in order to:

 - Remove the comments (that are here to help the readability of the simplicial complex).
 - Add the filtration timestamp. To ensure that the filtration is indeed simplicial, we will add the simplex in their increasing order. Since the complexes are simplicial, the filtration will be simplicial too.
